# Marvelous SharePoint site collection Migrator (MSSCM)
I am initiating and managing an open source project to migrate SharePoint site collections between different environments.<br />
These environments will be supported as the source and destination:<br />
<ul>
<li>SharePoint 2013</li>
<li>SharePoint 2016</li>
<li>SharePoint online</li>
</ul>
For the first release of the of this open source project, we will support the following scenario:<br />
To migrate the structure of a SharePoint site collection between different environments:<br />
<ul>
<li>Migrate columns</li>
<li>Migrate content types</li>
<li>Migrate lists</li>
</ul>
The programming language to develop these features is Microsoft Powershell. <br />
Here you can find the project on the github:<br />

All the contributions from SharePoint community are welcome!
